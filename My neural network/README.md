# My Neural Network from scratch

The idea here is to share defining class of neural networks that works with any number of input layers and output layers without using inbuilt python libraries.

[The sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) function is used in this model as an activation function, but you can use any other by implementing this code.
